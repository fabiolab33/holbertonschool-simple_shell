.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple Shell is a basic UNIX command line interpreter written in C as part
of the Holberton School curriculum.

It displays a prompt, waits for the user to enter commands, and executes
them using system calls such as fork, execve, and wait.

command execution using absolute paths or by searching the PATH environment
